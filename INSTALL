=============

You need libxml2 and boost c++ library to build flowWorkspace from source (using Rtools).

To install libxml2:

1. Download the pre-built binary from http://rglab.github.io/binaries/

2. unzip it (e.g. to c:\libxml2)
and you should see the directory structure like below in both i386 and x64 folder
   |-include
   |---libxml2
   |-----libxml (all *.h are here)
   |-lib (we should have static libary libxml2.a here)
   
3. set up the environment variable LIB_XML2 in order for flowWorkspace to find its library files and header files.  
You can do this by going to the "Environment Variables" dialog box and then clicking the "New" button. 
Enter "LIB_XML2" in the "Variable name" field, and /path/to/your/libxml2 (e.g. c:/libxml2) in the "Variable value" field. 
Remember to use "/" instead of "\" as the directory delimiter.


Here is the instruction for the building boost on windows from source:

1. download boost 1.52 and unzip it (e.g. to c:\boost_1_52_0)

2. build bjam
cd c:\boost_1_52_0\tools\build\v2\engine
build.bat mingw

3. copy bjam to the root dir of boost (i.e. c:\boost_1_52_0)
cp bin.ntx86\bjam.exe ..\..\..\..
cd ..\..\..\..

4. build library from source using bjam (here we only need to build serialization as static library)
for 64bit library:
bjam.exe --prefix=E:\boost\x64 toolset=gcc address-model=64 variant=release link=static install --with-serialization

for 32bit library:
bjam.exe --prefix=E:\boost\i386 toolset=gcc address-model=32 variant=release link=static install --with-serialization

5. re-organize the header folders  
cd e:\boost\i386\include\
mv boost_1_52\boost .

cd e:\boost\x64\include\
mv boost_1_52\boost .
 

Similarly, once boost is built, you also need to set up the environment variable LIB_BOOST in order for flowWorkspace
to find the library files and header files. 

You can download Rtools at http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/ which provides the resources for building R and R packages. You should add to the Path variable the paths to the various components of Rtools. Please read the "Windows Toolset" appendix at http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#The-Windows-toolset for more details.
